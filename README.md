# AI Agent Workflows with n8n.io

Welcome to my repository of automated AI agent workflows, built using the powerful open-source automation platform, [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/). This collection provides various pre-built workflows designed to leverage AI capabilities for different tasks, ready for you to customize and deploy.

## What is n8n.io?

n8n.io is a fair-code licensed workflow automation platform. It allows you to connect apps and services with an intuitive visual editor, enabling you to automate complex processes without writing extensive code.

## How to Use These Workflows

These workflows are provided as templates, allowing you to quickly set up and adapt AI agents to your specific needs. Follow the steps below to get started:

### Step 1: Install n8n.io

You have two primary options for installing and running n8n.io:

1.  **Local Host Installation:**
    * This is ideal for development and testing on your local machine.
    * Refer to the official n8n.io documentation for detailed instructions on setting up n8n locally (e.g., via Docker, npm, or desktop app): [n8n.io Installation Guide](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/)

2.  **Cloud Deployment:**
    * For production environments or if you prefer not to manage a local setup, you can deploy n8n.io on various cloud platforms.
    * n8n.io offers cloud hosting, or you can deploy it on your preferred cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, etc.) using their guides: [n8n.io Cloud Setup](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/)

### Step 2: Import the Workflow JSON File

Each AI agent workflow in this repository is stored as a `.json` file. To import a workflow into your n8n.io instance:

1.  **Navigate to the Workflows Section:** Once your n8n.io instance is running, go to the "Workflows" section in the n8n.io user interface.

2.  **Click "New" or "Add Workflow":** Look for a button or option to create a new workflow.

3.  **Import from JSON:** There will be an option to "Import from JSON" or "Upload JSON". Select this option.

4.  **Upload the File:** Choose the `.json` file from this repository that corresponds to the AI agent workflow you wish to use.

### Step 3: Adjust Credentials for Chat Models

Most AI agent workflows will interact with external AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, etc.). You will need to provide your own API keys or credentials for these services.

1.  **Locate Credential Nodes:** After importing the workflow, examine the workflow canvas. Look for nodes related to AI models (e.g., "OpenAI", "Google Gemini", "HTTP Request" nodes connecting to AI APIs).

2.  **Edit Credentials:**
    * Click on the relevant AI model node.
    * In the node's settings panel (usually on the right), you will find a "Credentials" section.
    * Click "Create New Credential" or "Edit Credential" and input your API key or other required authentication details.
    * **Important:** Never hardcode your API keys directly into the workflow JSON if you plan to share it. Always use n8n's credential management system.

### Step 4: Customize and Activate

Once the workflow is imported and credentials are set:

1.  **Review and Customize:** Examine the workflow logic. You may want to adjust prompts, add or remove nodes, or change the flow to better suit your specific use case.

2.  **Test the Workflow:** Use the "Test Workflow" or "Execute Workflow" button within n8n.io to ensure everything is working as expected.

3.  **Activate the Workflow:** When you are satisfied, activate the workflow (usually a toggle switch at the top right of the workflow editor) to make it run automatically based on its trigger.

Feel free to explore the different workflows and adapt them to your needs. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
